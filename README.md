# Barclays Bank UK Acquisition of Kensington Mortgages (2023) – Valuation and DCF Impact Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This project analyses the impact of Barclays Bank UK’s acquisition of Kensington Mortgages in 2023 on shareholder value and company valuation using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. The study compares short-term financial distortions caused by acquisition-related outflows with long-term strategic benefits of the deal.

Central Thesis:

> While the acquisition caused a significant one-off reduction in free cash flow and enterprise value in 2023, the long-term strategic benefits of market access, operational synergies, and funding capacity outweigh the short-term distortion and position Kensington for sustainable growth.

All valuation modelling was carried out using Excel, DCF frameworks, and company filings, supported by qualitative analysis of strategic drivers.

- Long-term: synergies and strategic positioning restore value.  
- DCF analysis: captures financial distortion but not full strategic benefit.
